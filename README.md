# Personal page

This repository contains the code for my personal page (https://degueldre.dev/). I wrote it as a Vue app on a whim because I wanted to use Vue a little bit. At the time of this writing, it uses Vue almost exclusively as a templating engine. I might do some cooler stuff with it at some point.
